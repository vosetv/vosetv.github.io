[vosetv.github.io](https://vosetv.github.io) is your video playlist for reddit.

Some of you may remember reddit.tv, a simple website that took videos from any subreddit and turned it into a playlist.

vose.tv attempts to recreate, and build on that concept, and fix many shortcomings of reddit.tv and many other clones.
